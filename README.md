# screensaver.embellir

*PLEASE NOTE* this is the very experimental branch which tries to use a
built-in http server instead of writing to disk. This might not work well with
Kodi.

A screensaver for Kodi

Features:

* Time, date, and weather visualizations in unusual, non-textual formats
* Both round and square format visualizations
* Adjustable colors
* More data visualzations planned

Currently this is BETA level software and under active development. Use at your own risk.
